    <h3 dir="ltr"> <br>I passed by the school where I studied as a boy<br>
        and said in my heart: here I learned certain things<br>
        and didn't learn others. All my life I have loved in vain<br>
        the things I didn't learn. I am filled with knowledge,<br>
        I know all about the flowering of the tree of knowledge,<br>
        the shape of its leaves, the function of its root system, its pests and parasites.<br></h3>
<br><br>
<h3 dir="rtl">,I'm an expert on the botany of good and evil<br>
    .I'm still studying it, I'll go on studying till the day I die<br>
    I stood near the school building and looked in. This is the room<br>
    where we sat and learned. The windows of a classroom always open<br>
    to the future, but in our innocence we thought it was only landscape<br>
    .we were seeing from the window<br></h3>
<br><br><h3 dir="ltr">The schoolyard was narrow, paved with large stones.<br>
    I remember the brief tumult of the two of us<br>
    near the rickety steps, the tumult<br>
    that was the beginning of a first great love.<br>
    Now it outlives us, as if in a museum,<br>
    like everything else in Jerusalem.<br></h3>
